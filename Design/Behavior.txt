* soduim (red Bigger) and chloride (blue Smaller)
	* user can add how much of each molecule
	* move around envrionment at random
	* reacts when touch each other: 75% on collision
	* Break apart when: 25% of each collision 
* Temperature
	* user can change temperature
	* incresing: make atoms move faster, increases chances of breaking apart, increases chances of reacting
	* decreasing: make atoms move slower, decrease chances of breaking apart, decreases chances of reacting
